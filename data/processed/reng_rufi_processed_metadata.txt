Datasets: Data used for these analyses were obtained from REF (ANO) (Date of data collection: 2014/12 - 2015/01). Processed datasets were created using the "data_preparation" script and are in '.csv' format. Each dataset contains a multitude of information regarding samples (each row is a ant queen). Below are the file names and their respective species, as well as column ids, and what each one represents.
data_rufi.csv: Camponotus rufipes
data_reng.csv: Camponotus renggeri

Column name:
(Original, raw data)
nest: Sampled nest ID
sampleid: Sampled ant (worker) ID
latitude: Nest location latitude
longitude: Nest location longitude
nw: Number of workers sampled per nest
nq: Number of queens per nest (estimated using COLONY 2.0)
efq: Efective number of queens per nest (estimated using COLONY 2.0)
nm: Number of male mates per queen (estimated using COLONY 2.0)
efm: Efective number of male mates per queen (estimated using COLONY 2.0)
nf: Number of offspring (workers) belonging to each queen
nfp: Propotion of offspring (workers) belonging to each queen
All columns starting with 'Cru' or 'Cgg': Alelle pair of different loci
